## Introduction to NLP :

* NLP Life cycle
* Reading text data
* Text processing

  * There are two main phases to natural language processing: data preprocessing and algorithm development.
    *  Data preprocessing involves preparing and "cleaning" text data for machines to be able to analyze it. 
    *  Preprocessing puts data in workable form and highlights features in the text that an algorithm can work with.

  * Tokenization - This is when text is broken down into smaller units to work with.
  * Stop word removal - This is when common words are removed from text so unique words that offer the most information about the text remain.
  * Lemmatization and stemming - This is when words are reduced to their root forms to process.
  * Part-of-speech tagging - This is when words are marked based on the part-of speech they are -- such as nouns, verbs and adjectives.

* Text to features
* Text exploration

## NLP applications:

* Noun Phrase extraction

```Python
import nltk

lines = 'lines is some string of words'
# function to test if something is a noun
is_noun = lambda pos: pos[:2] == 'NN'
# do the nlp stuff
tokenized = nltk.word_tokenize(lines)
nouns = [word for (word, pos) in nltk.pos_tag(tokenized) if is_noun(pos)] 

print nouns
>>> ['lines', 'string', 'words']

```

* Text similarity
* Parts of speech tagging
* Information extraction NER â€“ Entity recognition
* Topic modelling
* Sentiment analysis
* Word sense disambiguation
