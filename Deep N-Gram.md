# Importing Packages

In this notebook we will use the following packages:

Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open-source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. It offers a fast and efficient DataFrame object for data manipulation with integrated indexing.
os module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.
trax is an end-to-end library for deep learning that focuses on clear code and speed.
random module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.
itertools module implements a number of iterator building blocks inspired by constructs from APL, Haskell, and SML. Each has been recast in a form suitable for Python.

```

import pandas as pd 
import os
import trax
import trax.fastmath.numpy as np
import random as rnd
from trax import fastmath
from trax import layers as tl
```
