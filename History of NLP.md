Here, is are important events in the history of Natural Language Processing:

1950- NLP started when Alan Turing published an article called "Machine and Intelligence."

1950- Attempts to automate translation between Russian and English

1960- The work of Chomsky and others on formal language theory and generative syntax

1990- Probabilistic and data-driven models had become quite standard

2000- A Large amount of spoken and textual data become available


## History of Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The idea had emerged from the need for Machine Translation in the 1940s.Then the original language was English and Russian.

But the use of other words such as Chinese also came into existence in the initial period of the 1960s.

Then a lousy era came for MT/NLP during 1966, this fact was supported by a report of ALPAC, according to which MT/NLP almost died because the research in this area did not have the pace at that time. 

This condition became better again in the 1980s when the product related to MT/NLP started providing some results to customers. 

After reaching in dying state in the 1960s, the NLP/MT got a new life when the idea and need of Artificial Intelligence emerged. 

LUNAR is developed in 1978 by W.A woods; it could analyze, compare and evaluate the chemical data on a lunar rock and soil composition that was accumulating as a result of Apollo moon missions and can answer the related question. 

In the 1980s the area of computational grammar became a very active field of research which was linked with the science of reasoning for meaning and considering the user â€˜s beliefs and intentions. 

In the period of 1990s, the pace of growth of NLP/MT increased. Grammars, tools and Practical resources related to NLP/MT became available with the parsers. 

The research on the core and futuristic topics such as word sense disambiguation and statistically colored NLP, the work on the lexicon got a direction of research. 

This quest of the emergence of NLP was joined by other essential topics such as statistical language processing, Information Extraction and automatic summarising. 

The discussion on the history of NLP cannot be considered complete without the mention of the ELIZA, a chatbot program which was developed from 1964 to 1966 at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of MIT. 

It was created by Joseph Weizenbaum. It was a program which was based on script named as DOCTOR which was arranged to Rogerian Psychotherapist and used rules, to response the questions of the users which were psychometric-based. It was one of the chatbots which were capable of taking the Turing test at that time.
