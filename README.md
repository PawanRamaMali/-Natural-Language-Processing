# Natural-Language-Processing

* Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software.
* NLP is the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken and written - referred to as natural language. 
* It is a component of artificial intelligence (AI).

## What is Natural Language ?

* Natural language refers to the way we, humans, communicate with each other.
* Namely, speech and text.

We are surrounded by text. if you think about how much text you see each day:

* Signs
* Menus
* Email
* SMS
* Web Pages
* and so much more…

The list is endless.

Now think about speech.

We may speak to each other, as a species, more than we write. It may even be easier to learn to speak than to write.

Voice and text are how we communicate with each other.

Given the importance of this type of data, we must have methods to understand and reason about natural language, just like we do for other types of data.

## Challenge of Natural Language

Working with natural language data is not solved.

It has been studied for half a century, and it is really hard.

> It is hard from the standpoint of the child, who must spend many years acquiring a language … it is hard for the adult language learner, it is hard for the scientist who attempts to model the relevant phenomena, and it is hard for the engineer who attempts to build systems that deal with natural language input or output. These tasks are so hard that Turing could rightly make fluent conversation in natural language the centerpiece of his test for intelligence.

Natural language is primarily hard because it is messy. There are few rules.

And yet we can easily understand each other most of the time.

> Human language is highly ambiguous … It is also ever changing and evolving. People are great at producing language and understanding language, and are capable of expressing, perceiving, and interpreting very elaborate and nuanced meanings. At the same time, while we humans are great users of language, we are also very poor at formally understanding and describing the rules that govern language.

## From Linguistics to Natural Language Processing

### Linguistics

* Linguistics is the scientific study of language, including its grammar, semantics, and phonetics.
* Classical linguistics involves devising and evaluating rules of language. Great progress was made on formal methods for syntax and semantics, but for the most part, the interesting problems in natural language understanding resist clean mathematical formalisms.

* Broadly, a linguist is anyone who studies language, but perhaps more colloquially, a self-defining linguist may be more focused on being out in the field.

* Mathematics is the tool of science. Mathematicians working on natural language may refer to their study as mathematical linguistics, focusing exclusively on the use of discrete mathematical formalisms and theory for natural language (e.g. formal languages and automata theory).

### Computational Linguistics

* [Computational linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics) is the modern study of linguistics using the tools of computer science. 
* Yesterday’s linguistics may be today’s computational linguist as the use of computational tools and thinking has overtaken most fields of study.

> Computational linguistics is the study of computer systems for understanding and generating natural language. … One natural function for computational linguistics would be the testing of grammars proposed by theoretical linguists.

### Statistical Natural Language Processing

Computational linguistics also became known by the name of natural language process, or NLP, to reflect the more engineer-based or empirical approach of the statistical methods.

The statistical dominance of the field also often leads to NLP being described as Statistical Natural Language Processing, perhaps to distance it from the classical computational linguistics methods.

I view computational linguistics as having both a scientific and an engineering side. The engineering side of computational linguistics, often called natural language processing (NLP), is largely concerned with building computational tools that do useful things with language, e.g., machine translation, summarization, question-answering, etc. Like any engineering discipline, natural language processing draws on a variety of different scientific disciplines.

— How the statistical revolution changes (computational) linguistics, 2009.

Linguistics is a large topic of study, and, although the statistical approach to NLP has shown great success in some areas, there is still room and great benefit from the classical top-down methods.

Roughly speaking, statistical NLP associates probabilities with the alternatives encountered in the course of analyzing an utterance or a text and accepts the most probable outcome as the correct one. … Not surprisingly, words that name phenomena that are closely related in the world, or our perception of it, frequently occur close to one another so that crisp facts about the world are reflected in somewhat fuzzier facts about texts. There is much room for debate in this view.

— Page xix, The Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics, 2005.

## How does natural language processing work?

* NLP enables computers to understand natural language as humans do. 
* Whether the language is spoken or written, natural language processing uses artificial intelligence to take real-world input, process it, and make sense of it in a way a computer can understand.
* Just as humans have different sensors -- such as ears to hear and eyes to see -- computers have programs to read and microphones to collect audio. And just as humans have a brain to process that input, computers have a program to process their respective inputs. At some point in processing, the input is converted to code that the computer can understand.
