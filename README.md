# Natural-Language-Processing

* Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software.
* NLP is the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken and written - referred to as natural language. 
* It is a component of artificial intelligence (AI).

## How does natural language processing work?

* NLP enables computers to understand natural language as humans do. 
* Whether the language is spoken or written, natural language processing uses artificial intelligence to take real-world input, process it, and make sense of it in a way a computer can understand.
* Just as humans have different sensors -- such as ears to hear and eyes to see -- computers have programs to read and microphones to collect audio. And just as humans have a brain to process that input, computers have a program to process their respective inputs. At some point in processing, the input is converted to code that the computer can understand.
