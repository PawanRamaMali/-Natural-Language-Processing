# Natural-Language-Processing

* Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software.
* NLP is the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken and written - referred to as natural language. 
* It is a component of artificial intelligence (AI).

## What is Natural Language ?

* Natural language refers to the way we, humans, communicate with each other.
* Namely, speech and text.

We are surrounded by text. if you think about how much text you see each day:

* Signs
* Menus
* Email
* SMS
* Web Pages
* and so much more…

The list is endless.

Now think about speech.

We may speak to each other, as a species, more than we write. It may even be easier to learn to speak than to write.

Voice and text are how we communicate with each other.

Given the importance of this type of data, we must have methods to understand and reason about natural language, just like we do for other types of data.

## Challenge of Natural Language

Working with natural language data is not solved.

It has been studied for half a century, and it is really hard.

> It is hard from the standpoint of the child, who must spend many years acquiring a language … it is hard for the adult language learner, it is hard for the scientist who attempts to model the relevant phenomena, and it is hard for the engineer who attempts to build systems that deal with natural language input or output. These tasks are so hard that Turing could rightly make fluent conversation in natural language the centerpiece of his test for intelligence.

— Page 248, Mathematical Linguistics, 2010.

Natural language is primarily hard because it is messy. There are few rules.

And yet we can easily understand each other most of the time.

> Human language is highly ambiguous … It is also ever changing and evolving. People are great at producing language and understanding language, and are capable of expressing, perceiving, and interpreting very elaborate and nuanced meanings. At the same time, while we humans are great users of language, we are also very poor at formally understanding and describing the rules that govern language.

## How does natural language processing work?

* NLP enables computers to understand natural language as humans do. 
* Whether the language is spoken or written, natural language processing uses artificial intelligence to take real-world input, process it, and make sense of it in a way a computer can understand.
* Just as humans have different sensors -- such as ears to hear and eyes to see -- computers have programs to read and microphones to collect audio. And just as humans have a brain to process that input, computers have a program to process their respective inputs. At some point in processing, the input is converted to code that the computer can understand.
